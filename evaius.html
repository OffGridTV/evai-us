      The Translation Layer · Phased Reveal · Active Alignment Window
    </div>

    <p>
      EVAI defines a translation layer operating alongside existing vehicle and fleet architectures.
      Rather than replacing or interrupting first-layer systems, EVAI interprets what those systems
      already generate, enabling second-layer observation without interference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern vehicle platforms produce vast amounts of telemetry. However, raw telemetry alone does
      not produce insight. EVAI focuses on interpretation, alignment, and timing, allowing signal to
      emerge where visibility previously plateaued.
    </p>

    <h2>Why First-Layer Systems Plateau</h2>

    <p>
      First-layer systems are optimized for control, compliance, and operation. As complexity and
      scale increase, these systems naturally prioritize stability over interpretation. The result
      is an abundance of data with limited contextual visibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      EVAI does not attempt to optimize or override these systems. Instead, it operates in parallel,
      translating existing signals into aligned observations that remain dormant until conditions
      support clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Translation Over Extraction</h2>

    <p>
      Extraction assumes insight is missing. Translation assumes insight exists but remains
      unaligned. EVAI’s translation layer focuses on coherence, sequencing, and context rather than
      volume or intervention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this approach, EVAI enables phased visibility, allowing observations to surface
      progressively as alignment windows open.
    </p>

    <h2>Observation at Scale</h2>

    <p>
      Certain patterns do not appear at the level of individual assets. They emerge only across
      fleets, networks, and time. EVAI is designed to observe at this scale, where behavior,
      consistency, and deviation become visible without disruption.
    </p>

    <p>
      By remaining non-invasive, EVAI preserves system integrity while expanding interpretive
      capacity across vehicle architectures.
