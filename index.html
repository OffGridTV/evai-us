    <p>
      EVAI defines a translation layer operating alongside existing vehicle and fleet architectures.
      Rather than replacing or interrupting first-layer systems, EVAI interprets what those systems
      already generate, enabling second-layer observation without interference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern vehicle platforms produce continuous telemetry across increasingly complex systems.
      While data volume continues to grow, visibility often plateaus. EVAI focuses on interpretation,
      alignment, and timing, allowing signal to emerge where direct observation alone is insufficient.
    </p>

    <h2>The Translation Layer</h2>

    <p>
      First-layer systems are designed for operation, control, and compliance. EVAI operates in
      parallel, translating existing signals into coherent observations without altering system
      behavior. This approach preserves stability while expanding interpretive capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Translation assumes insight already exists within system output but remains misaligned. EVAI
      emphasizes sequencing, context, and coherence rather than extraction or intervention.
    </p>

    <h2>Phased Reveal</h2>

    <p>
      Not all visibility is beneficial at once. EVAI enables phased reveal, allowing observations to
      surface progressively as conditions support clarity. This prevents noise, preserves focus, and
      supports meaningful interpretation over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Active Alignment Windows</h2>

    <p>
      Certain insights emerge only when systems, timing, and context align. EVAI identifies and
      operates within these alignment windows, enabling observation at moments when signal coherence
      is naturally present rather than forced.
    </p>

    <p>
      By remaining non-disruptive, EVAI expands visibility across vehicle architectures while
      maintaining system integrity and operational continuity.
